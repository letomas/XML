               <h3 class="subsection-title"> background</h3>
               <p>A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a self-governing
                  dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to the British crown. Canada repatriated its
                  constitution from the UK in 1982, severing a final colonial tie. Economically and
                  technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to
                  the south across the world's longest international border. Canada faces the political
                  challenges of meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care, education,
                  social services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to the particular
                  concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its diverse
                  energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the environment.</p>

               <p>vast majority of Canadians are positioned in a discontinuous band within approximately
                  300 km of the southern border with the United States; the most populated province
                  is Ontario, followed by Quebec and British Columbia</p>
               <h3 class="subsection-title"> natural hazards</h3>
               <p>continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; cyclonic storms
                  form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic,
                  Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow
                  east of the mountains volcanism: the vast majority of volcanoes in Western Canada's
                  Coast Mountains remain dormant</p>
               <h3 class="subsection-title"> environment current issues</h3>
               <p>metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impacting agricultural
                  and forest productivity; air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting
                  lakes and damaging forests; ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural,
                  industrial, mining, and forestry activities</p>

                     Print Image Description This is the population pyramid for Canada. A population pyramid
                     illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights
                     about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population
                     is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females
                     on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups
                     represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups
                     at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually
                     evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends.

                  <li>conventional short form: Canada</li>
                  <li>etymology: the country name likely derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word "kanata"

               <p>Canada resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production,
                  and high living standards. Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
                  mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy
                  into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada has a large oil and natural gas sector
                  with the majority of crude oil production derived from oil sands in the western provinces,
                  especially Alberta. Canada now ranks third in the world in proved oil reserves behind
                  Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and is the worldâ€™s seventh-largest oil producer. TThe 1989
                  Canada-US Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (which
                  includes Mexico) dramatically increased trade and economic integration between the
                  US and Canada. Canada and the US enjoy the worldâ€™s most comprehensive bilateral trade
                  and investment relationship, with goods and services trade totaling more than $680
                  billion in 2017, and two-way investment stocks of more than $800 billion. Over three-fourths
                  of Canadaâ€™s merchandise exports are destined for the US each year. Canada is the largest
                  foreign supplier of energy to the US, including oil, natural gas, and electric power,
                  and a top source of US uranium imports. Given its abundant natural resources, highly
                  skilled labor force, and modern capital stock, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth
                  from 1993 through 2007. The global economic crisis of 2007-08 moved the Canadian economy
                  into sharp recession by late 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009
                  after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks emerged from the financial crisis
                  of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition
                  of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. Canadaâ€™s economy posted
                  strong growth in 2017 at 3%, but most analysts are projecting Canadaâ€™s economic growth
                  will drop back closer to 2% in 2018.</p>
