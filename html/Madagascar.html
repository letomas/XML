               <h3 class="subsection-title"> background</h3>
               <p>Madagascar was one of the last major habitable landmasses on earth settled by humans.
                  While there is some evidence of human presence on the island in the millennia B.C.,
                  large-scale settlement began between A.D. 350 and 550 with settlers from present-day
                  Indonesia. The island attracted Arab and Persian traders as early as the 7th century,
                  and migrants from Africa arrived around A.D. 1000. Madagascar was a pirate stronghold
                  during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and served as a slave trading center
                  into the 19th century. From the 16th to the late 19th century, a native Merina Kingdom
                  dominated much of Madagascar. The island was conquered by the French in 1896 who made
                  it a colony; independence was regained in 1960. During 1992-93, free presidential
                  and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In
                  1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s
                  and 1980s, returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested
                  between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession
                  of half of the country. In 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA
                  the winner. RAVALOMANANA won a second term in 2006 but, following protests in 2009,
                  handed over power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor
                  of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy
                  mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community, Madagascar held
                  UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance
                  minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA won a runoff election in December 2013 and was inaugurated
                  in January 2014. In January 2019, RAJOELINA was declared the winner of a runoff election
                  against RAVALOMANANA; both RATSIRAKA and RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA also ran in the first
                  round of the election, which took place in November 2018.</p>

               <p>Madagascar’s youthful population – just over 60% are under the age of 25 – and high
                  total fertility rate of more than 4 children per women ensures that the Malagasy population
                  will continue its rapid growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. The population
                  is predominantly rural and poor; chronic malnutrition is prevalent, and large families
                  are the norm. Many young Malagasy girls are withdrawn from school, marry early (often
                  pressured to do so by their parents), and soon begin having children. Early childbearing,
                  coupled with Madagascar’s widespread poverty and lack of access to skilled health
                  care providers during delivery, increases the risk of death and serious health problems
                  for young mothers and their babies. Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and
                  is prevalent among the poor, the uneducated, and rural households – as of 2013, of
                  Malagasy women aged 20 to 24, more than 40% were married and more than a third had
                  given birth by the age of 18. Although the legal age for marriage is 18, parental
                  consent is often given for earlier marriages or the law is flouted, especially in
                  rural areas that make up nearly 65% of the country. Forms of arranged marriage whereby
                  young girls are married to older men in exchange for oxen or money are traditional.
                  If a union does not work out, a girl can be placed in another marriage, but the dowry
                  paid to her family diminishes with each unsuccessful marriage. Madagascar’s population
                  consists of 18 main ethnic groups, all of whom speak the same Malagasy language. Most
                  Malagasy are multi-ethnic, however, reflecting the island’s diversity of settlers
                  and historical contacts (see Background). Madagascar’s legacy of hierarchical societies
                  practicing domestic slavery (most notably the Merina Kingdom of the 16th to the 19th
                  century) is evident today in persistent class tension, with some ethnic groups maintaining
                  a caste system. Slave descendants are vulnerable to unequal access to education and
                  jobs, despite Madagascar’s constitutional guarantee of free compulsory primary education
                  and its being party to several international conventions on human rights. Historical
                  distinctions also remain between central highlanders and coastal people.</p>

                     Image Description This is the population pyramid for Madagascar. A population pyramid
                     illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights
                     about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population
                     is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females
                     on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups
                     represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups
                     at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually
                     evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends.

            <section>
               <h3 class="subsection-title"> economy overview</h3>
               <p>Madagascar is a mostly unregulated economy with many untapped natural resources, but
                  no capital markets, a weak judicial system, poorly enforced contracts, and rampant
                  government corruption. The country faces challenges to improve education, healthcare,
                  and the environment to boost long-term economic growth. Agriculture, including fishing
                  and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of
                  GDP and employing roughly 80% of the population. Deforestation and erosion, aggravated
                  by bushfires, slash-and-burn clearing techniques, and the use of firewood as the primary
                  source of fuel, are serious concerns to the agriculture dependent economy. After discarding
                  socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s, Madagascar followed a World Bank- and
                  IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization until a 2009 coup d’état led many
                  nations, including the United States, to suspend non-humanitarian aid until a democratically-elected
                  president was inaugurated in 2014. The pre-coup strategy had placed the country on
                  a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low starting point. Exports of apparel
                  boomed after gaining duty-free access to the US market in 2000 under the African Growth
                  and Opportunity Act (AGOA); however, Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements
                  of the AGOA led to the termination of the country's duty-free access in January 2010,
                  a sharp fall in textile production, a loss of more than 100,000 jobs, and a GDP drop
                  of nearly 11%. Madagascar regained AGOA access in January 2015 and ensuing growth
                  has been slow and fragile. Madagascar produces around 80% of the world’s vanilla and
                  its reliance on this commodity for most of its foreign exchange is a significant source
                  of vulnerability. Economic reforms have been modest and the country’s financial sector
                  remains weak, limiting the use of monetary policy to control inflation. An ongoing
                  IMF program aims to strengthen financial and investment management capacity.</p>
