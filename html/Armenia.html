               <h3 class="subsection-title"> background</h3>
               <p>Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early
                  4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the
                  sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman.
                  During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman Empire instituted
                  a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in
                  at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans
                  to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered
                  by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenia remains involved in the protracted Nagorno-Karabakh
                  conflict with Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh was a primarily ethnic Armenian region
                  that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In
                  the late Soviet period, a separatist movement developed which sought to end Azerbaijani
                  control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 and escalated
                  after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
                  By the time a ceasefire took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian support,
                  controlled Nagorno‑Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories. The 1994
                  ceasefire continues to hold, although violence continues along the line of contact
                  separating the opposing forces, as well as the Armenia-Azerbaijan international border.
                  The final status of Nagorno-Karabakh remains the subject of international mediation
                  by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which
                  works to help the sides settle the conflict peacefully. The OSCE Minsk Group is co‑chaired
                  by the US, France, and Russia. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993
                  in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh
                  and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, Armenia
                  and Turkey signed Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries, but neither
                  country ratified the Protocols, and Armenia officially withdrew from the Protocols
                  in March 2018. In 2015, Armenia joined the Eurasian Economic Union alongside Russia,
                  Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. In November 2017, Armenia signed a Comprehensive
                  and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU. In spring 2018, Serzh SARGSIAN
                  of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) stepped down and Civil Contract party leader
                  Nikol PASHINYAN became prime minister.</p>

                     Print Image Description This is the population pyramid for Armenia. A population pyramid
                     illustrates the age and sex structure of a country's population and may provide insights
                     about political and social stability, as well as economic development. The population
                     is distributed along the horizontal axis, with males shown on the left and females
                     on the right. The male and female populations are broken down into 5-year age groups
                     represented as horizontal bars along the vertical axis, with the youngest age groups
                     at the bottom and the oldest at the top. The shape of the population pyramid gradually
                     evolves over time based on fertility, mortality, and international migration trends.

               <p>Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial
                  sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister
                  republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to
                  small-scale agriculture and away from the large agro industrial complexes of the Soviet
                  era. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders
                  with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as
                  a result of Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh
                  region. Armenia joined the World Trade Organization in January 2003. The government
                  has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but
                  anti-corruption measures have been largely ineffective. Armenia will need to pursue
                  additional economic reforms and strengthen the rule of law in order to raise its economic
                  growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially
                  given its economic isolation from Turkey and Azerbaijan. Armenia's geographic isolation,
                  a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have
                  made it particularly vulnerable to volatility in the global commodity markets and
                  the economic challenges in Russia. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial
                  and governmental support, as most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or
                  managed, especially in the energy sector. Remittances from expatriates working in
                  Russia are equivalent to about 12-14% of GDP. Armenia joined the Russia-led Eurasian
                  Economic Union in January 2015, but has remained interested in pursuing closer ties
                  with the EU as well, signing a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with
                  the EU in November 2017. Armenia’s rising government debt is leading Yerevan to tighten
                  its fiscal policies – the amount is approaching the debt to GDP ratio threshold set
                  by national legislation.</p>

               <p>the dispute over the break-away Nagorno-Karabakh region and the Armenian military
                  occupation of surrounding lands in Azerbaijan remains the primary focus of regional

                  in Armenia and Azerbaijan; Turkish authorities have complained that blasting from
                  quarries in Armenia might be damaging the medieval ruins of Ani, on the other side
                  of the Arpacay valley; in 2009, Swiss mediators facilitated an accord reestablishing
                  diplomatic ties between Armenia and Turkey, but neither side has ratified the agreement
                  and the rapprochement effort has faltered; local border forces struggle to control
                  the illegal transit of goods and people across the porous, undemarcated Armenian,
                  Azerbaijani, and Georgian borders; ethnic Armenian groups in the Javakheti region
